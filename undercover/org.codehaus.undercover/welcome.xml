<intro>Continuous testing builds on the automated developer support in
Eclipse to make it even easier to keep your Java code well-tested, if
you have a JUnit test suite.  With continuous testing enabled, as you
edit your code, Eclipse runs your tests quietly in the background, and
notifies you if any of them fail or cause errors.  To get started, see
